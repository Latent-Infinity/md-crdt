# Clippy configuration per Rust Code Standards
# See: .docs/Rust Code Standards.md
#
# Note: Lint levels (warn/allow) are configured via:
# - #![warn(...)] / #![allow(...)] in lib.rs files
# - Command-line flags in CI/justfile (see `just lint`)
#
# This file configures Clippy thresholds and settings.

# MSRV - Minimum Supported Rust Version
msrv = "1.85"

# Allow slightly larger enums before warning
enum-variant-size-threshold = 200

# Cognitive complexity threshold for functions
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Maximum function parameters with bool type
max-fn-params-bools = 3

# Allow more struct fields with bool type
max-struct-bools = 4
